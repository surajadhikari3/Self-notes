Difference between kafka vs rabbitmq vs activemq

| Feature            | Kafka                            | RabbitMQ                        | ActiveMQ                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Model              | Log-based Pub/Sub                | Message broker (Queue/Topic)    | Queue-based broker        |
| Message Durability | High (disk-first)                | Good (memory-first)             | Good                      |
| Throughput         | Very high                        | Medium                          | Medium                    |
| Use Case           | Event streaming, log aggregation | Task queues, real-time messages | Legacy systems, JMS-based |
| Message Ordering   | Per partition                    | Manual config needed            | Fair                      |
| Replay Messages    | Easy (offsets)                   | Not supported natively          | Limited                   |


Kafka --> High throughput low latency, fault tolerance , streaming data, analytics 
RabbitMq --> Task queues, retry logic, real time apps.
ActiveMq --> Legacy systems using JMS or spring JMS integration..



### 3. **Latest Java Version Features**

#### ðŸš€ Java 21 (LTS):

- **Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**: Lightweight threads managed by JVM, great for high-concurrency apps (like web servers).
    
- **Sealed Classes**: Restrict which other classes can extend or implement them. Adds control and security in API design.
    
- **Pattern Matching**: Cleaner type checks (e.g., `if (obj instanceof String s)`). --> in java 16..
    
- **Record Patterns + Switch Enhancements**: Used for destructuring complex data.


âœ… 5. **Building a New System â€“ Planning Phase**

Before starting development:

- **Requirements gathering** (Functional/Non-functional)
    
- **Tech stack selection**:
    
    - Backend: Spring Boot
        
    - Frontend: Angular/React
        
    - DB: Relational (Postgres/MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB)
        
    - Messaging: Kafka/RabbitMQ
        
- **Scalability**: Containerization (Docker), orchestration (K8s)
    
- **Security**: JWT, OAuth2, Mutual TLS
    
- **Observability**: Logs (ELK), Metrics (Prometheus), Tracing (Zipkin)
    
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins/GitHub Actions pipelines
  
  ### 6. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) â€“ Cross-org Resource Sharing**

To share resources like **S3** between two VPCs (e.g., two companies):

- **VPC Peering**: Allows network-level communication between VPCs.
    
- **Resource Policy**: S3 bucket policy with cross-account access.
    
- **IAM Roles**: AssumeRole between accounts for secure access.
    
- **PrivateLink**: Secure, scalable service sharing without peering.
