### **Can you describe the flow of a request in a Spring Cloud-based microservices system?**

**Flow:**

1. Request hits Spring Cloud Gateway.
    
2. Token is validated.
    
3. Gateway routes it to the target service (resolved via Eureka).
    
4. Internal service-to-service calls use Feign with load balancing.
    
5. Calls are traced via Sleuth, monitored in Zipkin.
    
6. Any config changes are pushed by Spring Cloud Bus.
