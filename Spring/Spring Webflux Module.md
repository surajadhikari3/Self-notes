Webflux is a reactive web framework in Spring 5 for building non-blocking(asynchronous), event-driven web applications....

Core concepts.....


### üîë Core Concepts

| Concept       | Description                                            | Return Type                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Mono**      | 0 or 1 element                                         | `Mono<T>`                       |
| **Flux**      | 0 to many elements (stream)                            | `Flux<T>`                       |
| **WebClient** | Reactive client to call services in aynchronous manner | `Mono<T>`/`Flux<T>`             |
| **WebFlux**   | Framework to build reactive APIs                       | `@RestController` + `Mono/Flux` |


üåê What is **WebClient**?

WebClient is non-blocking, reactive HTTP client introduced in the spring 5 as a part of the WebFlux module. 

Key Features

| Feature             | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üßµ **Non-blocking** | Doesn't block the thread while waiting for HTTP response.              |
| ‚ö° **Reactive**      | Works with reactive types like `Mono` and `Flux`.                      |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **Asynchronous** | Great for calling remote services (e.g., other microservices or APIs). |
| üí° **Replacement**  | Replaces `RestTemplate`, which is synchronous and blocking.            |

```
WebClient client = WebClient.create();

Mono<String> result = client.get()
    .uri("http://example.com/data")
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(String.class);


```

What is gRPC ?

gRPC(Google Remote Procedure call ) is a high performance, open-source, universal RPC(Remote procedure call) framework developed by Google. It allows client and server applications to communicate transparently and efficiently -- especially betn microservices in a distributed system..


### üß† Think of it Like:

> "Calling a method on a remote server as if it were a local method in your code."

### üì¶ gRPC vs REST

| Feature         | gRPC                                 | REST                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Protocol        | HTTP/2                               | HTTP/1.1                      |
| Message Format  | Protocol Buffers (compact binary)    | JSON (text, larger payload)   |
| Performance     | Faster (binary, multiplexed)         | Slower (textual, sequential)  |
| Streaming       | Built-in client/server/bidirectional | Needs hacks (WebSockets, SSE) |
| Contract-first  | Yes (via `.proto` file)              | No (usually schema-less)      |
| Browser support | Not direct (needs gRPC-Web)          | Native                        |


A gRPC call using Protocol Buffers is:

- **~5x smaller in payload size** compared to JSON
    
- **~10x faster** in high-throughput scenarios
    

Especially relevant in **microservices architectures** where services talk to each other frequently.

### ‚úÖ When to Use gRPC:

- High-performance internal microservice communication
    
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat, video, IoT)
    
- Polyglot environments (services written in different languages)
    
- Streaming requirements (client-server or bidirectional)



It supports synchronous, asynchronous communication along with the streaming support..
