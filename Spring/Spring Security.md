| **Q1:** How does Spring Security work under the hood?                   | It uses a **filter chain** that intercepts HTTP requests, performs **authentication**, then checks **authorization** before allowing access. All security data is stored in the `SecurityContextHolder`. |
| **Q2:** How do you secure REST APIs?                                    | Use **JWT tokens** with stateless sessions. Disable CSRF for APIs and enable `HttpBasic` or `Bearer` token authentication.                                                                               |
| **Q3:** What is the role of `UserDetailsService`?                       | It is used to fetch user credentials from a custom source like a database during authentication.                                                                                                         |
| **Q4:** What‚Äôs the difference between `hasRole()` and `hasAuthority()`? | `hasRole("ADMIN")` checks for `ROLE_ADMIN`. `hasAuthority("ROLE_ADMIN")` checks the authority directly.                                                                                                  |
| **Q5:** How does Spring Security prevent CSRF?                          | It adds a token to each request and validates it on the server. This prevents external malicious sites from submitting forms on behalf of the user.                                                      |


JWT (Json web token) Based security) 

## Typical Interview Questions on JWT

| Question                                     | Sample Answer                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q:** Why use JWT instead of sessions?      | JWT enables **stateless authentication**, making it ideal for distributed or microservice architectures. No server-side storage required. |
| **Q:** How do you validate JWT?              | Using the secret key, verify signature and expiration. Parse the token to extract the subject (username).                                 |
| **Q:** Where do you store JWT in the client? | Typically in **localStorage** or **Authorization header** (preferable for security).                                                      |
| **Q:** What are JWT vulnerabilities?         | XSS (if stored in localStorage), token leakage, no logout capability unless token is invalidated or blacklisted.                          |


> In stateless JWT authentication, CSRF protection is **not required** because tokens are manually sent in the `Authorization` header ‚Äî **not automatically attached** by the browser like cookies. Since the server doesn‚Äôt rely on sessions, the typical CSRF attack vector doesn't exist.

‚ÄúCSRF happens because browsers automatically attach cookies, like session IDs, to cross-site requests. That‚Äôs why in session-based authentication we need CSRF tokens. With JWT-based authentication, tokens are usually sent in the `Authorization` header or manually attached by the client, so a malicious site cannot force the browser to include the token. This removes the automatic CSRF risk. However, JWTs are still vulnerable to XSS if stored in localStorage, and if you store them in cookies, you still need CSRF protection.‚Äù

# Cookie vs JWT ‚Äî Direct Comparison Chart

| Aspect                      | Cookie-based (Session)             | JWT-based (Token)                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Server Storage              | YES (Session in server memory)     | NO (Stateless)                                 |
| Browser sends automatically | YES (cookies auto-attached)        | NO (manual Authorization header)               |
| Scalability                 | Poor (session replication needed)  | Excellent (no session tracking)                |
| CSRF risk                   | YES (cookies auto-send)            | NO (tokens sent manually)                      |
| Performance                 | Session lookup needed              | Only token decoding needed                     |
| Logout/Invalidate           | Easy (delete session)              | Hard (token must expire or blacklist manually) |
| Typical Usage               | Traditional web apps (login forms) | APIs, Mobile apps, Microservices               |


Monilithic application --> State(Sessions is maintained)

User login --> Server validates And generates the token with jsession-id---> Sends the cookie to the client. --> Browser stores the cookie and sends cookie with every request --> Server validates. the cookie with the jsession id and serves the resource


Here since the browser stored the jsession id hacker can use the jsession id to make the malicious call then the csrf token is needed-->

Server fetch the csrf token in the hidden field in the html and based on the csrf token and the jsession id the server authorize the users..

For interview answers..

Cookie-based auth stores user sessions on the server, which breaks down in distributed systems due to the need for sticky sessions or a shared session store. This adds latency, complexity, and violates microservice statelessness.  

JWT solves this by being stateless and self-contained ‚Äî any microservice can validate the token without extra network calls or storage, making it ideal for scalable, cloud-native architectures.

                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Authorities (roles/permissions)

In the stateless authentication with spring security using JWT need to set the SecurityContextHolder on every request


### What happens on each request:

1. The JWT is sent in the HTTP request (usually as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
    
2. A **custom filter** (often extending `OncePerRequestFilter`) intercepts the request.
    
3. The filter:
    
    - Extracts the JWT
        
    - Validates it
        
    - Parses the claims (username, roles, etc.)
        
    - Builds an `Authentication` object
        
    - **Sets it into `SecurityContextHolder`**
        
4. After that, the request continues with an authenticated context.

for sending the credentials in the basic auth we send in the request headers

curl -u john:1234 https://active-life-canada/api/data

This automatically sets:
```
`Authorization: Basic am9objoxMjM0`
```
since the credentials is base64 encoded..
