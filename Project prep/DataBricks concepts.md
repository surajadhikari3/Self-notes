DataLakeHouse

A **Data Lakehouse** is a modern data architecture that **combines the best features of a data lake and a data warehouse** into one unified platform. It aims to handle **both structured (e.g., SQL tables) and unstructured data (e.g., logs, images, videos)** efficiently, supporting **analytics, machine learning, and real-time processing**.

---

### 🔍 Quick Definitions First:

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Data Lake**|Stores raw, unstructured, and semi-structured data at scale (e.g., JSON, Parquet, CSV, video files).|
|**Data Warehouse**|Stores structured, cleaned, and processed data for analytics (e.g., tables, SQL-friendly).|
|**Lakehouse**|Unifies the raw flexibility of a **lake** with the structure and governance of a **warehouse**.|

---

### 🏗️ Lakehouse Architecture: Key Features

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Unified Storage**|Uses a data lake (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob) as the central storage layer.|
|**Transaction Support**|Adds **ACID transactions** (like a database) on top of lake files using tools like **Delta Lake** or **Apache Iceberg**.|
|**Schema Enforcement**|Applies schema validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.|
|**BI + AI Together**|Supports both **business intelligence (BI)** (e.g., dashboards, SQL) and **AI/ML workloads** (e.g., training models) in one place.|
|**Cost Efficient**|Uses cheap object storage with warehouse-like capabilities, reducing cost.|

---

### 🧠 Analogy (Layman’s Terms):

> Think of a **data warehouse** as a perfectly organized library, and a **data lake** as a giant pile of books, videos, and documents.  
> A **data lakehouse** is like a super-smart librarian who organizes everything on-the-fly, gives you access to all data types, and keeps it all consistent.

- **Amazon Athena + S3 + Glue Catalog** (Lakehouse combo)
    

---

### ✅ Use Cases:

- Real-time analytics on clickstream data
    
- Unified ML pipelines using raw + cleaned data
    
- Cost-effective storage for IoT, logs, images, and relational data

### ✅ What is a **DLT (Delta Live Table) Pipeline** in Databricks?

**DLT Pipeline**, short for **Delta Live Tables pipeline**, is a **managed data pipeline framework** provided by **Databricks** that simplifies **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes using **declarative** syntax and built-in **data quality enforcement**.

---

### 🚀 **In Simple Terms:**

Think of a **DLT pipeline** as a smart system where you define **what data transformations** you want, and Databricks automatically handles **how** to run and optimize them, monitor them, and ensure data quality.

---

### 🧠 **Key Features of DLT Pipelines:**

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|🧾 **Declarative ETL**|You declare _what_ should happen (`CREATE LIVE TABLE ...`) instead of writing imperative Spark jobs.|
|📊 **Data Quality Rules (Expectations)**|Use `EXPECT` clauses to define and enforce data quality checks at the row level.|
|🔁 **Automatic Lineage Tracking**|Visual graph of all table dependencies in the pipeline.|
|⚙️ **Incremental Processing**|DLT supports change data capture (CDC) and only processes **new or updated data**.|
|🔍 **Monitoring and Logging**|Built-in metrics, error tracking, and performance monitoring for pipelines.|
|☁️ **Fully Managed**|Databricks handles orchestration, scaling, retries, and optimizations under the hood.|

---

### 📂 **Types of DLT Tables:**

| Type                   | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LIVE TABLE`           | A regular transformed output table.                                        |
| `LIVE STREAMING TABLE` | Used for real-time streaming sources (Kafka, Auto Loader, etc.).           |
| `LIVE VIEW`            | A logical view used for transformation or staging logic, not materialized. |

---

### 🧾 **Example: A Simple DLT Pipeline**

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

@dlt.table
def raw_data():
    return spark.read.format("json").load("/mnt/raw-data")

@dlt.table
@dlt.expect("valid_age", "age > 0")
def clean_data():
    df = dlt.read("raw_data")
    return df.filter("age IS NOT NULL")
```

---

### 🧭 **Use Cases:**

- Building and maintaining **bronze → silver → gold** pipelines.
    
- Automating **data ingestion + transformation** + **validation**.
    
- Implementing **real-time** or **batch** ETL workflows with **minimal infrastructure code**.
    
- Ensuring **data reliability** with built-in **testing and monitoring**.
    

---

### ✅ **Benefits:**

- Less boilerplate code
    
- Higher data reliability and trust
    
- Faster development and maintenance
    
- Great for both **streaming and batch pipelines**
    
- Native support for **Unity Catalog** and **data lineage tracking**

we can run the sql directly in the raw and unstructured data like parquet, json file by creating the temorary table or view

or by using the autoloader.


In the context of **Databricks** and modern data architectures, **Apache Iceberg** is an **open table format** designed for large-scale, high-performance **data lake** systems.

## 🧊 What is Apache Iceberg?

**Apache Iceberg** is an **open-source table format** for huge analytic datasets. It provides **ACID transactions**, **schema evolution**, **time travel**, and efficient **query planning** for data lakes.

Think of it as a **modern replacement for traditional Hive tables** or even **Delta Lake**, built for massive scale and cloud environments.

---

## 🔍 Key Features of Apache Iceberg:

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**ACID Transactions**|Guarantees consistent reads/writes without data corruption|
|**Time Travel**|Query old versions of data using snapshots|
|**Schema Evolution**|Supports safe column add/drop/rename|
|**Partition Evolution**|You can change partitioning without rewriting the full table|
|**Hidden Partitioning**|Optimizes queries without requiring users to know partition logic|
|**Compatibility**|Works with Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, Hive, and more|
|**Open Format**|Not tied to any one vendor — community-driven|

You can:

- Read/write Iceberg tables from Databricks clusters
    
- Use Iceberg tables in multi-engine architectures (e.g. shared between Spark and Trino)
    
- Leverage Iceberg in **Delta Lake UniForm** (Delta tables readable as Iceberg)

## ✅ Summary

**Apache Iceberg** is a modern, open table format designed to bring data warehouse-like features (ACID, versioning, schema evolution) to massive data lakes — with strong support across engines and cloud platforms.
