Is built on 

Apache Arrow --> It prevents the overhead of sterilization/Deserialization as it lets to access and share the same memory data.(Avoid copying)
It is like universal memory analytics.

Apache Spark ( it is also used by the data bricks for streaming and ETL process) 

Apache Ice.-berg ( Almost similar to the Delta Lake ACID properties, Schema Evolution, Time Travel of data , also provides the versioning )


**Apache Arrow provides a standardized in-memory format** that allows **multiple platforms, tools, and languages to access and process the same data in memory without copying or converting it**.

But to clarify your specific question:

---

## ‚úÖ Is Apache Arrow **Centralized**?

Not exactly **centralized** in the sense of a server or a shared memory hub, but:

- It **defines a common memory format**.
    
- This format can be **shared across processes or tools**, as long as they are **in the same memory space** (e.g., via Arrow Flight or shared memory) or exchange Arrow-formatted data.
    

You can think of Arrow as a **"universal language" for in-memory analytics**, not a centralized data store.

## üì¶ How Does Arrow Enable Multi-Platform Sharing?

### üîÑ Zero-Copy Sharing

- Data is stored in memory in a columnar format using Arrow.
    
- Any system that understands Arrow can **access it directly without deserializing**.
    

### üß† Shared Use Cases

|Use Case|Example|
|---|---|
|**Spark ‚Üî Pandas**|Use Arrow to pass data from a PySpark DataFrame to Pandas without copying|
|**Python ‚Üî R**|Share data frames between Python and R via Arrow buffers|
|**DuckDB ‚Üî Arrow**|Query Arrow tables directly from DuckDB in memory|
|**ML systems**|Train ML models directly on Arrow buffers (no CSV/Parquet conversion needed)|

## üîå Bonus: Arrow Flight

Arrow also includes a protocol called **Apache Arrow Flight**:

- Enables **high-speed, distributed data transport** using the Arrow format.
    
- Can be used in place of JDBC/ODBC for fast cross-system queries.
    
- It's ideal for building centralized data services that deliver data in Arrow format to multiple consumers.
