**WebSocket** is a communication protocol that creates a **persistent, two-way connection** between a **client** (like a browser) and a **server**, allowing both to **send and receive messages at any time** in **real time**, without repeatedly opening new connections.

### 🧠 In One Line:

> WebSocket is like a continuous conversation between your browser and server — they stay connected and talk back and forth instantly.


It sets the full duplex bidirectional communication over the single TCP connection...

### 🧠 Analogy

- **TCP** = A raw pipeline where you can send a stream of bytes — but you must define your own protocol on top.
    
- **WebSocket** = A fully-structured conversation on top of TCP, with predefined ways to send messages (frames) — and starts from an HTTP handshake.

## ✅ WebSocket Lifecycle Overview

1. **HTTP Upgrade**: WebSocket starts with a regular HTTP request.
    
2. **Protocol Upgrade**: Server responds with `101 Switching Protocols`.
    
3. **TCP connection persists**, now upgraded to WebSocket.
    
4. Client/server can now exchange messages in **frames** (text/binary/ping/pong).
    
5. **Connection stays open** until either side closes it.

### 📌 Summary

- WebSocket **uses TCP** underneath.

    
- It is **higher-level**, **message-oriented**, and **browser-compatible**.
    
- TCP is **lower-level**, **byte-stream-oriented**, and **not browser-friendly**.
    

Think of WebSocket as **“HTTP+TCP+framing” for real-time messaging**.


Web-socket works on the STOMP protocols

### 🔧 What is STOMP?

**STOMP** stands for **Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol**.  
It is a **lightweight, text-based protocol** used for communication between **clients and message brokers** (like the Spring WebSocket message broker).

It’s like **HTTP for messaging** — a simple way to send structured commands like `CONNECT`, `SEND`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `DISCONNECT`, etc.

---

### 🧠 Why Do We Use STOMP with WebSockets?

**Raw WebSocket** is just a socket — it has no built-in idea of "topics", "subscriptions", or message routing.  
STOMP gives us a **standard structure** to build messaging apps over WebSockets.


2nd part -- 

**Bidirectional streaming of updates** means that **both the client and the server can continuously send updates to each other at the same time** — like a **two-way conversation** where both parties can speak and listen independently and simultaneously.


### 🧰 Technologies That Support Bidirectional Streaming:

| Technology    | Supports Bidirectional Streaming? | Notes                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **WebSocket** | ✅ Yes                             | Full-duplex communication over TCP                    |
| **gRPC**      | ✅ Yes (gRPC with streams)         | Uses HTTP/2 to support streaming                      |
| **Socket.IO** | ✅ Yes                             | Built on top of WebSocket with fallback support       |
| **Kafka**     | ❌ Not true bidirectional          | Only supports producer → topic → consumer             |
| **HTTP/REST** | ❌ No                              | Client must initiate each request (polling/long-poll) |

### 🔧 In Spring Boot – Using WebSockets for Bidirectional Streaming:

1. **Client sends analytics filter updates**
    
2. **Server pushes real-time matching data back**  
    → Both happen over the same open WebSocket channel.

### 💡 Summary:

> **Bidirectional streaming of updates** = _Both sides talk and listen at the same time — without waiting for turns._  
> It enables **real-time, interactive applications** with **high responsiveness**.
