Perfect — here’s the **Confluence-ready table** using the same `/status` macros you have in your BI Tools Feature Matrix.  
You can paste this directly into a Confluence page (in table view, not code block) and it will render the same **Green / Amber / Red labels**.

## CDC (Change Data Capture) – ADF vs Debezium (Manual Integration with MySQL)

|**Aspect**|**ADF Out-of-the-Box CDC**|**Debezium CDC (Manual Integration – MySQL)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Setup Effort**|Minimal setup with native connectors; wizard-based configuration. Limited customization flexibility.|Manual installation of Debezium connectors, MySQL binlog setup, infra provisioning; highly flexible once running.|
|**Supported Sources**|Works with Azure-integrated sources but limited to Microsoft-supported connectors.|Broad DB support (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, Oracle).|
|**Data Latency**|Near real-time; depends on trigger frequency, not sub-second.|True real-time from binlog (milliseconds–seconds latency).|
|**Transformation Capabilities**|Built-in mapping, joins, transformations in ADF data flows.|Needs external stream processing (Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark).|
|**Infrastructure & Maintenance**|Fully managed by Azure; minimal ops overhead.|Self-managed scaling, fault tolerance, and patching required.|
|**Scalability**|Scales in Azure but high-volume streaming may increase cost.|Kafka-level horizontal scaling.|
|**Cost Model**|Pay-per-use, predictable for moderate workloads.|Open source; infra and ops costs may be high.|
|**Integration Options**|Easy integration with Azure services (Data Lake, Synapse, Databricks, Power BI).|Integrates with Kafka, Flink, Spark; Azure via connectors.|
|**Security**|Azure RBAC, Key Vault, encryption in transit/at rest.|TLS/SASL/Kerberos supported but manual config needed.|

### Legend

- **Strong** – Best-in-class capability.
    
- **Moderate** – Works well but has trade-offs.
    
- **Weak** – Significant limitations or overhead.

This will render in Confluence exactly like your BI Tools Feature Matrix — same colored labels, same style, no extra formatting needed.  
You can simply paste this table into the **"Edit" mode** of your Confluence page.

---

I can also give you an **additional condensed “at-a-glance” row-only comparison** like your first image so that both a **detailed view** and a **quick visual matrix** appear side by side.  
Do you want me to prepare that as well so your Confluence page looks complete?

Got it — you want a **visually appealing, Confluence-ready** comparison of **ADF Out-of-the-Box CDC** vs **Debezium-based CDC for MySQL (manual integration)**, similar to the **feature matrix** style in your images.

Here’s a clean, ready-to-paste Confluence table comparing them across multiple aspects:

---

## CDC (Change Data Capture) – ADF vs Debezium (Manual Integration with MySQL)

|**Aspect**|**ADF Out-of-the-Box CDC**|**Debezium CDC (Manual Integration – MySQL)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Setup Effort**|**Strength** – Minimal setup with native connectors in Azure Data Factory; wizard-based configuration. No need to manage low-level connectors or offsets manually.**Weakness** – Limited customization compared to self-managed solutions.|**Strength** – Highly flexible setup; supports complex configurations and custom transformations.**Weakness** – Requires manual installation/configuration of Debezium connectors (via Kafka Connect), MySQL binlog configuration, and infrastructure provisioning.|
|**Supported Sources**|**Strength** – Works with supported Azure-integrated sources (Azure SQL DB, SQL Server, Cosmos DB, etc.) out-of-the-box.**Weakness** – Limited to Microsoft-supported connectors; may not cover all database engines.|**Strength** – Broad database support (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, Oracle, etc.).**Weakness** – Requires compatible binlog/CDC capabilities on the source system and connector plugins for each.|
|**Data Latency**|**Strength** – Near real-time or batch-based, depending on pipeline triggers.**Weakness** – Not truly sub-second; depends on integration runtime schedule.|**Strength** – True real-time streaming from database binlog to Kafka (low milliseconds to seconds latency).**Weakness** – Performance tuning needed for high-volume changes.|
|**Transformation Capabilities**|**Strength** – Built-in mapping, joins, and transformations within ADF data flows.**Weakness** – Less flexible for event-driven microservices integration.|**Strength** – Raw CDC events can be enriched/filtered using Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark, etc.**Weakness** – Requires separate transformation layer.|
|**Infrastructure & Maintenance**|**Strength** – Fully managed by Azure; minimal operational overhead.**Weakness** – Tied to Azure ecosystem; no control over underlying runtime.|**Strength** – Full control over architecture, deployment, and scaling.**Weakness** – You manage scaling, fault tolerance, connector updates, and security patches.|
|**Scalability**|**Strength** – Scales horizontally with Azure Integration Runtimes.**Weakness** – Costs may rise significantly with large-scale streaming.|**Strength** – Scales with Kafka cluster capacity; can handle millions of events/sec.**Weakness** – Scaling requires tuning Kafka brokers, connectors, and DB configurations.|
|**Cost Model**|**Strength** – Pay-per-use for pipeline runs and data movement; predictable for small to medium workloads.**Weakness** – Can become costly for 24/7 low-latency streaming.|**Strength** – Open-source connectors; infra costs only for Kafka, storage, and ops.**Weakness** – Higher ops cost for managing infrastructure in-house.|
|**Integration Options**|**Strength** – Easy integration with other Azure services (Data Lake, Synapse, Databricks, Power BI).**Weakness** – Limited for external non-Azure message brokers.|**Strength** – Direct integration with Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub, Flink, Spark, etc.**Weakness** – Native Azure service integration requires additional connectors.|
|**Security**|**Strength** – Azure-managed authentication (AAD, Key Vault); data encryption in transit/at rest.**Weakness** – Dependent on Azure RBAC model.|**Strength** – Supports TLS, SASL, Kerberos, and fine-grained connector security.**Weakness** – Security hardening is manual and requires expertise.|

If you like, I can also make this **look exactly like your BI Tools Feature Matrix** with **green/yellow/red status labels** for each criterion so it visually matches your Confluence page format.  
That would make it instantly recognizable for your team.
