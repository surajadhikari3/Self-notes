Workspace 

Shared Vs Users

### **Users Workspace (`/Users`)**

- **Path**: `/Users/<email>`
    
- **Purpose**: Personal, private development space for individual users.
    
- **Access**:
    
    - Only accessible by the user who owns it (unless permissions are explicitly granted).
        
    - Great for experimentation, prototyping, testing, or learning.
        

#### ‚úÖ Typical Use Cases:

- Writing personal notebooks
    
- Running test jobs
    
- Drafting pipelines or ETL logic

### ü§ù **2. Shared Workspace (`/Shared`)**

- **Path**: `/Shared`
    
- **Purpose**: Collaboration space shared across multiple users and teams.
    
- **Access**:
    
    - Anyone with access to the Databricks workspace can be given permission to view or edit resources in `/Shared`.
        
    - Permissions can be configured at the folder or notebook level.
        

#### ‚úÖ Typical Use Cases:

- Production-ready notebooks
    
- Shared dashboards or reports
    
- Team notebooks or documentation
    
- Scheduled workflows or shared utilities

###  **Access Control Comparison**

|Feature|`/Users` Workspace|`/Shared` Workspace|
|---|---|---|
|Default visibility|Private to owner|Visible to team (if shared)|
|Collaboration|No (by default)|Yes|
|Access Control Supported?|Yes|Yes|
|Best For|Individual development|Team collaboration|

---

###  Recommendation

- **Use `/Users/email`** for experimentation and POCs.
    
- **Move to `/Shared`** once code or notebooks need to be reviewed, used in a job, or shared with teammates.

Managed Vs Foreign Catalog:


|Category|Managed Catalog|Foreign Catalog|
|---|---|---|
|Ownership|Databricks-managed|External system-managed|
|Source Type|Internal (Delta Lake, Unity Catalog)|External systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Glue)|
|Storage Location|DBFS or external cloud storage linked via Unity Catalog|Resides in the external system; not copied to Databricks|
|Data Governance|Fully governed by Unity Catalog|Governance remains with external source|
|Read/Write Capability|Read and write supported|Mostly read-only|
|Table Metadata|Managed by Unity Catalog|Virtualized from external source|
|Access Control|Fine-grained (catalog, schema, table, column, row)|Catalog-level only|
|Audit Logging|Supported via Unity Catalog system tables|Not supported|
|Data Lineage|Tracked automatically|Not available|
|Delta Sharing|Supported|Not supported|
|Performance Optimization|Uses Delta caching and execution plans|Depends on source system performance|
|Schema Evolution|Supported|Not applicable|
|External Location Support|Supported|Not applicable|
|Tagging and Classification|Supported|Not supported|
|Use Case|New lakehouse implementations with full governance needs|Querying data from legacy or federated external sources|
|Best For|Secure, governed analytics on Delta Lake|Ad-hoc queries, BI access, or phased migration scenarios|
|Data Federation|Not required|Required (via Lakehouse Federation)|
|Integration Type|Native to Unity Catalog|JDBC-based or cloud-native federation|
|Migration Path|End-state target|Temporary bridge or hybrid access strategy|
