Absolutely. Here's a **documentation-ready explanation** of **group-level `GRANT`** and **user-level `REVOKE`** in **Databricks Unity Catalog**, including **who can perform the actions**, **how to do it**, and **important behavior notes** under the **additive access control model**.

# üîê Unity Catalog Permission Model: Group-Level Grant vs User-Level Revoke

## üìò Overview

In Unity Catalog, permissions are **additive**, meaning users gain access based on the **union of all grants** across user-level and group-level permissions. There is **no concept of DENY**, so **revoking a permission from a user does not block inherited access from a group**.

---

## üë§ Who Can Grant or Revoke Permissions?

|Role|Capabilities|
|---|---|
|**Metastore Admin**|Can manage all grants at any level|
|**Catalog Owner**|Can grant/revoke access within their catalog|
|**Schema Owner**|Can grant/revoke permissions on schemas and their child objects|
|**Table Owner**|Can grant/revoke access on specific tables or views|

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Only users with **ownership** or **appropriate privileges** on a Unity Catalog object can issue `GRANT` or `REVOKE` statements.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Grant Permissions to a Group

### üìå SQL Syntax

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE catalog.schema.table_name TO `group_name`;
```

### üìç Example

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales_db.revenue.transactions TO `analysts`;
```

This grants `SELECT` privileges to all users in the group `analysts`.

---

## ‚ùå How to Revoke Permissions from a User

### üìå SQL Syntax

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE catalog.schema.table_name FROM `user_email`;
```

### üìç Example

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE sales_db.revenue.transactions FROM `john.doe@example.com`;
```

> üîî **Important**: If `john.doe@example.com` is a member of `analysts`, he will still retain `SELECT` access **via the group**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Behavior Notes under Additive Access Model

|Rule|Description|
|---|---|
|**Additive Permissions**|Permissions from multiple sources (user + group) are combined|
|**REVOKE is not DENY**|`REVOKE` removes a specific grant but does **not override** inherited access from a group|
|**No Negative Permissions**|You cannot explicitly deny access in Unity Catalog|
|**Group Grants > User Revokes**|Group-level grants will still apply even if the same permission is revoked at the user level|

## üö´ How to Restrict a User Who Inherits Access via a Group

If you need to **prevent a specific user from accessing** an object, even though their group has access:

|Option|Recommendation|
|---|---|
|‚úÖ **Remove user from the group**|Remove the user from the group that has access|
|‚úÖ **Create a custom group**|Create a group like `analysts_except_john` and assign only desired users|
|‚úÖ **Use row-level security**|Apply dynamic views or data masking to restrict access at query time|
|‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt rely on `REVOKE`|It does not block inherited access via groups|

---

## üîç Auditing Effective Permissions

To see what access a user has:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE catalog.schema.table_name;
```

To check **who has access and from which path** (user or group), use:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS TO `user_email` OR `group_name`;
```

---

## üß† Summary

|Task|SQL Command|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Grant permission to group|`GRANT SELECT ON TABLE x TO group_name`|Grants access to all members|
|Revoke from individual|`REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE x FROM user_email`|Does not remove inherited access|
|Restrict a user fully|Remove from group / Apply data policy|Additive model doesn‚Äôt allow deny|
