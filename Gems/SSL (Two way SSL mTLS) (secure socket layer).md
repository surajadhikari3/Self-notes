### 🔁 Two-Way SSL(mutual TLS/mTLS) Handshake Step-by-Step:

1. **Client Hello**:  
    The client initiates the handshake by sending:
    
    - Supported SSL/TLS versions
        
    - Cipher suites
        
    - A random number
        
2. **Server Hello**:  
    Server responds with:
    
    - Chosen protocol and cipher
        
    - Server’s certificate (signed by a CA)
        
    - Optional: A **request for client certificate** (this is the key difference from 1-way SSL)
        
3. **Client Certificate (if requested)**:  
    The client sends:
    
    - Its certificate (signed by a trusted CA)
        
4. **Key Exchange**:
    
    - Both client and server agree on a shared secret using **asymmetric encryption** (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, RSA)
        
    - This shared secret is used to generate **session keys**
        
5. **Certificate Verification**:
    
    - Server verifies the client’s certificate (e.g., via trust store)
        
    - Client verifies the server’s certificate (e.g., via browser or trust store)
        
6. **Finished Messages**:
    
    - Both sides send encrypted "Finished" messages using the session key to confirm the handshake.
        
7. **Secure Communication Begins**:
    
    - Now they switch to symmetric encryption for performance (e.g., AES) 



### **Can you describe the steps involved in a Two-Way SSL handshake?** (In brief)

**Answer:**

1. **ClientHello**: Client sends supported TLS version, cipher suites, and random number.
    
2. **ServerHello + Certificate + CertificateRequest**: Server sends its certificate and requests client certificate.
    
3. **Client Certificate**: Client sends its certificate + key exchange data.
    
4. **Both parties verify each other's certificates** using trusted CA chains.
    
5. **Session key is established**, and encrypted communication begins.





**Certificate generation process**


A **CA** validates identities and issues a **digitally signed certificate** that contains:

- The public key of the entity (e.g., your website)
    
- Identity details (domain, company name, etc.)
    
- CA’s digital signature

### Step-by-Step: How CA Works

#### 🛠️ Step 1: Generate Key Pair

- The **client** (e.g., a website) generates a **private-public key pair**.
    

#### 📩 Step 2: Send Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

- The client creates a **CSR** that includes:
    
    - Public key
        
    - Organization/domain info
        
    - Signature made using **private key**
        
- This CSR is sent to the CA (via RA if used).
    

#### 🔍 Step 3: Validation by CA/RA

- The CA or RA verifies the **identity** (e.g., via domain ownership, legal documents).
    
- If everything checks out, they **digitally sign** the CSR to create a **certificate**.
    

#### 📄 Step 4: Issue Certificate

- CA issues a **signed X.509 certificate** that includes:
    
    - Public key
        
    - Identity details
        
    - Validity period
        
    - CA’s digital signature
        
- This certificate is returned to the client.
    

#### 🌐 Step 5: Use in Communication (e.g., HTTPS)

- The certificate is installed on the **web server**.
    
- When a browser visits the server:
    
    - It checks the **certificate's digital signature**
        
    - Verifies that it’s signed by a **trusted CA**
        
    - Ensures it's **not expired or revoked**
        
    - If valid, establishes an encrypted session (TLS/SSL)

Key takeway....

Assymmetric encryption is computational heavy, complex yet more secure used for the key exchange 
Once the handshake is happened between server and the client they switch to the symmetric encryption like AES
symmetric encryption is 1000x. faster than the asymmetric encryption.

Few concepts for the certificates

keystore --> holds the self keys and certs
Truststore --> Holds CA and certs whom we want to trust.
				We add CA (Certificate authorities) who provide the cert or 
					some case we can even add the cert itself (in most of the internal application...)
	
keytool --> Cmd line to generate key value pair and to export or add it to the keystore and truststore...

For the JVM the default cacerts path is 

	`$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` --> This is the jvm level trustore where we add the certificate whom we want to trust....

| Concept        | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Truststore** | Stores **public certificates** of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). Used to **verify incoming SSL certificates**. |
| **Keystore**   | Stores your **own private keys and certificates**. Used to **identify yourself** (e.g., in mutual TLS).                |
