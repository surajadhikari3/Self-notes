 
#### **What is the Java Collections Framework (JCF)?**

Java Collections Framework is a set of **interfaces and classes** that support operations on **data structures like lists, sets, queues and maps**. It provides algorithms and utilities for sorting, searching, and more.

Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList...

| Feature            | ArrayList                   | LinkedList                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Backed By          | Dynamic Array               | Doubly Linked List          |
| Insertion/Deletion | Slower O(n) due to shifting | Faster at ends 0(1)         |
| Access (get)       | Fast 0(1)                   | Slow O(n)                   |
| Memory             | Less memory overhead        | More (due to node pointers) |

Use the Arraylist for the heavy read operation
Use LinkedList for frequent inserts/removals....


Main interfaces in Collection Framework?

List --> ArrayList, LinkedList
Set --> HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet
Queue --> PriorityQueue, Deque

Map(is also a Interface) is not a subtype of Collection in java


![[Pasted image 20250512162816.png]]#### **Difference between HashSet and TreeSet?**

| Feature     | HashSet                  | TreeSet                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Order       | No order                 | Sorted (natural or comparator)                                             |
| Performance | Faster (uses hash table) | Slower (uses Red-Black Tree)                                               |
| Nulls       | Allows one null          | No null elements allowed(as there is no natural ordering for null value..) |

HashMap Vs HashTable 

HastTable implements Map<K, V> interface 

| Feature       | HashMap                                        | Hashtable             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Thread Safety | Not synchronized                               | Synchronized (Legacy) |
| Null Keys/Val | Allows one null key, and multiple null value.. | No null key/value     |
| Performance   | Faster                                         | Slower                |
-> Concept if it is not thread safe and normal it is faster and allowed the null 
    but if it is thread safe or ordered then it is slow and does not allowed null.
# How does HashMap work internally?

- Uses an **array of buckets** where each bucket is a **linked list (or tree in Java 8+)**.
    
- Stores **key-value pairs** using the key's **hashCode()** to find the bucket.
    
- If keys collide (same hash), uses chaining (linked list or tree).
    
- `equals()` is used to resolve key equality in a bucket.

**Java 8 Optimization**: If one bucket becomes too long, the linked list turns into a **balanced tree (Red-Black Tree)** for faster access.

Why do we override equals() and hashCode() ?

-> To ensure that keys work correctly in hash-based collections like (HashMap and HashSet).
-> If equals() is overriden, but hashCode() is not, two equal objects might end up in different   buckets.

üìå Rule:

- Equal objects must have **same hashCode**.
    
- Unequal objects can have same or different hashCode.


#### 8. **What is ConcurrentHashMap? How is it different from HashMap?**

|Feature|HashMap|ConcurrentHashMap|
|---|---|---|
|Thread-safe|‚ùå No|‚úÖ Yes|
|Synchronization|‚ùå None|‚úÖ Uses segments/locks (Java 7) or CAS (Java 8)|
|Null keys/values|‚úÖ Allowed|‚ùå Not allowed|

üéØ Use `ConcurrentHashMap` in **multi-threaded** environments for high concurrency and thread safety.


#### **How does CopyOnWriteArrayList work? (Thread Safe..)**

**Answer**:  

It's a **thread-safe variant** of `ArrayList`. On every write (add, remove), it creates a **new copy** of the underlying array.  

Ideal for **read-heavy** scenarios like caching.

Multimap ?
Is a data structure that maps keys to multiple values. Unlike a standard Map<K,V> where each key maps to a single value, a Multimap<K,V> can assossiate a key with collection of values.

With a **Multimap**, both `"apple"` and `"banana"` can be stored for the same key:

It is from the google gauva..

java


```
Multimap<String, String> multimap = ArrayListMultimap.create();
multimap.put("fruit", "apple");
multimap.put("fruit", "banana");
System.out.println(multimap.get("fruit")); // [apple, banana]

```
Interview Ques

How can we implement two interface in the class having the default method?(Diamond problem..)

In Java, **a class can implement multiple interfaces**, even if **both interfaces have `default` methods**‚Äîbut **you must resolve any conflict** if the same method signature exists in more than one interface

--> You have to resolve the conflicting method which to implement or else you will get the comilation error..

--> To prevent it we must override the method like 

![[Pasted image 20250523100008.png]]

### üîé Key Rules

1. If **only one interface** has the `default` method ‚Üí no conflict.
    
2. If **two interfaces** have the same `default` method ‚Üí **you must override** it.(or comilatiion error)
    
3. You can use `InterfaceName.super.method()` to call the desired default version.
   
   
   It is kind of diamond problem too...
   
   
   
#   Remember LinkedList implements Queue no the List interface
